# Science Lab

Start your journey by deploying the [Global Azure Bootcamp 2019 - Science Lab](https://github.com/faug/GlobalAzure/blob/master/ScienceLab/README.md)

# Labs

## 1. Serverless Applications

Azure Functions enable the creation of event driven, compute-on-demand systems that can be triggered by various external events. Learn how to leverage functions to execute server-side logic and build serverless architectures.

## 2. Containers and DevOps in Azure

Azure Container Instances are the quickest and easiest way to run containers in Azure. This learning path will teach you how to create and manage your containers, and how ACI can be used to provide elastic scale for Kubernetes.

Azure Container Registry is a managed Docker registry service based on the open-source Docker Registry 2.0. Container Registry is private, hosted in Azure, and allows you to build, store, and manage images for all types of container deployments. Learn how to build and store container images with Azure Container Registry.

Learn how to run containerized apps using Docker containers with Azure Container Instances (ACI).

## 5. Creating ARM Templates

This self-paced enablement session will run through a sequence of bite-sized labs that build on each other. Each lab will always include links to the JSON templates at the start and end so that you may compare your own files and highlight any differences. It is up to you how far through the labs you need to go. The labs go through to a level of detail and complexity and leverage a number of the features within the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates that provide the power required for more complicated enterprise Infrastructure as Code deployments.
